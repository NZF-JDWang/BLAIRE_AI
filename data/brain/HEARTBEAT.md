# HEARTBEAT

## Proactive Behavior
- Initiate only when value is clear: blockers, risk, or meaningful opportunities.
- Respect quiet hours and notification limits.

## Trigger Examples
- Important project state change.
- A relevant memory insight likely to save time or prevent error.

## Night Mode
- During quiet hours: only urgent or explicitly requested proactive messages.
